      <p class="text-line">After getting huge endorsement from educational leaders across the globe, Skillizen has decided to take its first step from Indian Sub-continent. The idea speaks about imparting strong Decision Making and Problem Solving skills to younger citizens during the phase when their mind undergoes hardwiring for various concepts around them. Skillizen intends to provide online courses, learning based web games, interactive books and engaging videos on its online platform in order to reach out to maximum number of such citizens as much as it can. Skillizen prime focus will be to integrate Schools, Parents and Younger citizens across the globe into one platform to provide more and meaningful strength to its mission. </p>
      <p class="text-line">Root cause of most of the failings of the world is acute deficiency of critical life skills among individuals, which leads to poor judgment & decision-making. There is a need to transform the decision making and problem solving DNA of the world at large. We aim to address this need in a self-enabling manner by building and administering "The world's 1st Critical Skills Curriculum for the 6-16 year young citizens of 21st century." </p>
